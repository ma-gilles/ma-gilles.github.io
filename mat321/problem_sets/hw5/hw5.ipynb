Instead, one could run CG on $L^{-1}A(L^{-1})^T$ where $M = LL^T$ a Cholesky decomposition of $M$ (assuming it is SPD). Luckily, the entire CG iteration applied to $L^{-1}A(L^{-1})^T$ may be rewritten as an iteration that only involves $M^{-1} = (L^{-1})^{T}L^{-1} $ and $A$, thus the Cholesky decomposition is unnecessary. If you are interested, you may read the details in [these notes](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6210/2019fa/lec/2019-11-25.pdf). For this exercise, it is sufficient to know that having two black boxes is sufficient to run the CG iteration: one to compute $Ax$ and one to compute $M^{-1}x$. Furthermore, there exist a similarity transformation: $M^{-1} A =  (L^{-1})^T \\left(  L^{-1}A(L^{-1})^T \\right) L^T $ between $L^{-1}A(L^{-1})^T$ and $M^{-1}A$, they have the same eigenvalues.\n",
