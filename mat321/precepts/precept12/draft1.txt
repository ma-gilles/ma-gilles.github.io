Task 3. Stiff differential equations often have the property that solutions curves
will converge to a common curve regardless of the intial condition. To visualize
this, solve the stiff differential equation from Task 2 for 100 different values of y0
between −1 and 1 use plot(x, y); hold all in a loop to plot all of these all on the
same plot.
Bonus Task. Use Adams-Moulton and Adams-Bashforth to solve Tasks 1 and 2
to relative accuracy 1e-12.
Double bonus task. Consider the function
f (x) = exp(−4x2 ) + exp(−4(|x| − π)2 )
on the torus [−π, π]. Numerically, this function is smooth and periodic on the torus
since
exp(−4π 2 ) = 7.1572e − 18

so the integral of this function on the torus should be π to machine precision. By
the Euler-Maclaurin formula we have that for any fixed m

where T (n) denotes trapezoid rule with n points. That is, eventually trapezoid
rule will converge to the integral faster than n−2m for any m. The issue is that the
constant in the Big-O depends on m so initially the error rate might appear to be
n−2 until we “overcome” the constant. To visualize this, run the code:
f = @(x) exp(-4*x.^2) + exp(-4*(abs(x)-pi).^2);
m = 200;
err = zeros(m,1);
for j = 1:m
n = 2*j;
h = 2*pi/n;
x = -pi:h:pi-h;
v = h*sum(f(x));
err(j) = abs(v - sqrt(pi));
end
ms = 2*(1:m);
plot(log10(ms),log10(err)); hold all;
for j = 2:2:8
ref = log10(ms.^-j) - log10(2^-j)+log10(err(1));
plot(log10(ms),ref)
end
