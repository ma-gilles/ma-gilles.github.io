# Marc Aur√®le Gilles's academic webpage

I am an assistant professor in the department of Mathematics at Princeton University. 

I am interested in applied mathematics pretty broadly but particularly in problems involving numerical linear algebra. In the past, I have worked in numerical analysis, computational imaging and applied statistics with applications to radar sensing, X-ray imaging and augmented reality.
My recent work has been on algorithms for cryo-EM. I built and maintain RECOVAR, a software tool for reconstructing flexible proteins from large and noisy electron microscopy datasets based on this work.
